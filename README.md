# Home Automation System Circuit Control via Esp32 
In this project, I designed a small circuit, and this design represents miniature models of some of the electronic devices we use in our homes. The electronic components I used in this circuit are: <br/>
-Temperature sensor <br/>
-RGB LED <br/>
-DC motor <br/>
-Motor driver, and <br/>
-ESP32 microcontroller. <br/>
Thanks to the integrated Wi-Fi module of the ESP32, I was able to connect it to the internet and retrieve data via Wi-Fi from Firebase, as well as send some data to this database." And There is a link for [Android Application](https://github.com/alperkayandan/home-automation-system-android-application) of this project.
